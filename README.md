#About This Site

## Source and Inspiration
This site was adapted and converted from [Bootstrapmade.com's DevFolio Bootstrap Portfolio HTML Template](https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/).  For legal reasons, I am not including the paid version of the template's source code here, but the free version available on that site should give you a good idea of what I started with.
